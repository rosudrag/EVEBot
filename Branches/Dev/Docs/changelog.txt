*********************************************************
                     CHANGELOG:
*********************************************************
Boy this file is old..

Changes Currently in Trunk
New Features:
- Close all message and chat boxes every 15 seconds
- Added check for drone shortage. When finished, will return to base if insufficient drones are available
- Added Minimum Drones In Space combat tab option to the UI
- Added MinimumShieldPercent, linked to UI
- Added use of Config.Miner.Distribute lasers setting (who would ever want to set it to false??)
- Optional Mining drone support
- Added Bot Mode selection to Main tab of UI
- Moved configuration options to be character-specific. Multiple characters will be stored per config file.
- Added UI option "Bookmark Last Position" for mining operations.
- obj_Miner: Added support for bookmarking last position and returning to it after emptying cargo
- obj_Miner: Jetcan support.  Check "Use JetCan" on the UI to jettison ore instead of hauling it when full.
- Added downtime support.  Script will return to station at 10 minutes before downtime.
- Added Player Avoidance Range - bot will warp to a new belt if a player is detected inside the given range.
- Added Player Avoidance for Standing Detection (Needs Testing, but appears to be functional)
- Add checkbox for "Always Shield Boost"
- Shield boost will activate if always shield boost, hostiles nearby, or shield < 100%
- Add slowboating check - if distance to roid is more than 3 * laser range, move belts.
- Added ICE Mining support - check Ice Mining on the mining tab to seek ice belts.
	Note that ice mining implicitly turns off multiple mining target selection, and turns off distribute lasers. This is by intentional and by design.
	This was a fairly major change to a lot of systems, so if there are any problems with standard mining, speak up.


Behavior Fixes/Changes:
- Use new ActiveDrone index to recall only active drones, instead of all drones owned by you.
- Added miner abort on drone shortage
- Added miner abort on armor or shield low
- If we're emergency warping, Drone recall will only wait 1 second for drones to enter ship before allowing warp to begin
- More checks for cargo full so it responds faster
- Pre-warp check now deactivates all mining lasers and unlocks targets
- Belt bookmarks must start with Belt: now
- Drones will be told to return to bay on script shutdown.. we won't wait for them, tho.

Bug Fixes:
- Amadeus fixed DoGetAvailableAmmo in the extension, so crystal switching works now.
- Fixed problem where ming laser crystal wouldn't be loaded if the laser had no crystal already.
- Removed extra "evebot" from the UI title.
- Drones will only attempt to launch if you have some
- Fixed Ship:Pulse to only execute if outside station
- UI: fixed reversed checked/unchecked for checkboxes
- Fix problem with bot not performing actions, introduced in rev 168
- Removed missed UpdateHudStatus call
- Fixed drone shortage check and tested.
- (really) Fixed script end when miner hits ABORT state
- Fixed race condtion in drone shortage check vs launching drones
- Fixed problem with all lasers not getting acitvated on 2 roids
- Updated many of the UI options to link to proper config values
- Changed check for isxeve to ensure we don't try to load without it.
- Added some missing safety checks to a few obj_Ship methods
- Jetcan support: check distance on existing/known cans as well
- Jetcan support: fix rename function
- Fix missing declare in obj_Drones, probably the cause of peoples missed drone launches.
- Fix spurious drone shortage aborts.
- Typo in logmsg in obj_drones
- Typo in ui line had script end on abort condition
- Fix missing open parenthenis in obj_jetcan
- Fix ) instead of } in obj_evebot
- Fixed typos in obj_Skills.iss
- Fixed typo in obj_configuration
- Fix mining mainloop so it won't attempt lock while in warp.
- Fixed problem with dynamic bookmark usage where if you had a bookmark with your characters first name (or whole name, for single-name chars) it might use that bookmark instead of the dynamic one.
- Fix wrong variable name causing bot not to unpause after an abort condition is fixed.
- Fixing unexpected case where bookmarks are deleted by the user while the bot is operating.
- Fix slider text so it's initialized properly on load for combat and miner tabs
- Fix: All Pulse methods now check EVEBot.Paused
- Fix: Hopefully fixed case where ship would approach an asteroid to 0km
- Fix: if there are no belts in the area, return to station, don't just sit there

Architecture Work:
- A first pass at removing the bot logic from EVEBot.iss and pushing it into the bot classes.
- Created UI:UpdateConsole to replace function UpdateHUdStatus
- Moved more ui-related functions into the ui object
- fixed miner not working after initial hauler object update.
- Added new defines to defines.iss, appname, version, svn rev # is split out and reassembled nicely.
- Added AutoPatcher initial support (new file, obj_AutoPatcher.iss)
- Refactored everything to use UI:UpdateConsole
- Removed oCore.iss
- UI: fixed up checkboxes to use checkbox instead of commandcheckbox, fixed overlay text
- Added UI.CommandBuffer, to buffer log messages which occur before main() is called. Once main() is called,
  we call ui -reload, which properly populates all the elements with data from the Config.* objects.  The
  commandbuffer is then replayed back to the statuswindow so we can see the log msgs from before the reload.
- SVN: Moved /Tags/* to /tags/Historical/*
- SVN: Tagged previous beta release as /tags/0.93
- SVN: SVN work is in preparation for autopatching of release and development versions of EVEBot
 - Basic Combat Object Introduction
	- Fail Safe Run [UI Combat Child]
	- Drone Combat
	- Combat Targeting
	- Added Skeleton for Fighter Bot (Included XML Update)
	- Added Skeleton for Branches of Combat: Defense and Offense
- Removed combat elements from obj_Miner (for now, until obj_Combat is further along)
- Changed Minimum Armor/Shield percent UI elements from textentry to slider, with dynamic label change to show value
- More work on the autopatcher
- Removed duplication of timestamp for startup msgs
- Consolidated Cargo full checks with bool Ship.CargoFull
- initial pass at miner laser short cycling code
- Removed generate_lasers_set.iss
- Moved all bot logic into the bot modules
- Moved most of the remaining non-object globals into bot modules.
		Bot modules register when loaded, and set their state independent of one another.
		All bot modules are given a chance to process their state every 2 seconds
- Added obj_Bookmarks.iss
- Created obj_Bookmarks (instantiated as Bookmarks) to handle temporary bookmark management
- added Config.Miner.BookmarkLastPosition
- Renamed Ship.GotoBookMark, Ship.WarpToBookMark
- Added obj_JetCan
- added Cargo.TransferOreToJetcan
- Added obj_Ship:CargoHalfFull
- Updated UI element for Use JetCan

-Changed jetcan window check function to use the new Entity.LootWindow member
-obj_Login.iss added for autoconnect functionality.
 	 Not integrated yet.
- Added GameHour and GameMinute to obj_Misc
- Renamed obj_Misc to obj_EVEBot.iss, same with the objects.
	It now performs downtime shutdowns, and handles the return to base duties for all abort actions.
- Removed all ForcedReturn and m_abort members and actions, and moved them to use EVEBot.ReturnToStation.
- Added Obj_Social.iss to prepare for player/npc  detection options
- Separate the logic for hessingers addition of player and standing detection.  Player detection just requires a belt change.  Standing detection requires docking.
- Fix: Rename all Astroid -> Asteroid. No functional effect.
- AutoLogin script turned into an fps-timed pulse-based state engine.  Not enabled yet.
- UI: Added Login name, password fields, and use auto login checkbox
- Arch: Converted all ${play} to EVEBot.Paused. Removed ${play}

0.899.1-0.90: Complete rewrite of mining code, drone code, asteroid selection code, cargo handling, etc.  This should set the core of the future bot nicely.
- Drone Support
- GUI Stabilization
- Targeting fixed
- Multiple lasers on 1 roid fixed
- Swapping crystals for t2 mining lasers implemented, working.
- Station hangar isn't opened till we verify we have stuff to move.
- Added obj_Configuration, an object to hold config variables and store them to disk in evebot.xml
- Added shutdown events to the objects which have initialize events.
- Fixed not targeting asteroids when it warped to belt.  Fixed emptying of config file, unexplained lavishsettings burp that will need followup.
- Changed a few waits.
- Added more debug output.
- Worked more on T2 mining crystal auto change
- Fixed math error typo in SetbotState.
- Removed redundant code from oCombat.iss
- Removed extra xml files
- Created central config file, evebot.xml, currently only stores ORE info.
- Created obj_Asteroid
- Created obj_Ship
- Created obj_Drones
- Created obj_EVEBotUI
- Created obj_Cargo
- Created obj_Station
- All function calls which could be converted to methods or members have been, for those functions.
- Note that very little changes have occured in oCombat, except where necessary for it to call a function which was moved.
- Rewrote cargo transfer routines, they should be 100% reliable now, and extensible for other cargo types in the future.
- Created basic use of bookmarked asteroid locations, any bookmarks that start with Belt: or Belt will be iterated thru at random.  This is not up to par yet, I wouldn't use it.  Need to integrate bookmark iteration with blacklisting for empty (or empty of desired) ore types and fall back to overview list of belts if so (which should also be added to blacklist).
- Rewrote EB_GlobalVariablesDaemon.iss, see obj_EVEMONUI.iss for an example of how to do this without making a 2nd script.
